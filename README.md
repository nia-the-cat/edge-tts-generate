***Built with Copilot (mostly Claude Opus) and ChatGPT Codex. While I dislike AI fundamentally, I am a hypocrite and this solves issues I have and makes the above extension support more than just Japanese, with anecdotally more stability from my testing.***

A language-agnostic Anki add-on that generates high-quality text-to-speech audio for your flashcards using Microsoft Edge's TTS engine. 

This extension can be built on MacOS, Linux, and Windows, but MacOS and Linux functionality is not tested and very likely does not work. This is a planned feature.

# What does this do?

This is a text-to-speech add-on for Anki that uses Microsoft Edge's TTS (edge-tts) synthesis engine to generate natural-sounding audio for your flashcards. It's perfect for language learning, pronunciation practice, or any study material where hearing the content is helpful.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Batch Processing** - Generate audio for multiple cards at once
- 🌍 **20+ Languages** - Supports major world languages with neural voices
- 🎛️ **Voice Customization** - Adjust pitch, speed, and volume
- 👂 **Voice Preview** - Listen to voices before generating
- 🔧 **Flexible Options** - Append, overwrite, or skip existing audio
- 🚀 **Zero Setup** - All dependencies bundled, works out of the box
- 📝 **Smart Text Processing** - Handles HTML, brackets, and special characters
- 💻 **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 💾 **Remember Settings** - All preferences persist across Anki sessions

# Requirements

- **Anki version**: 2.1.35+ 
- **Python**: 3.9+ (bundled with Anki, no need to install if you're a user)
- **Internet connection**: Required for TTS generation only (no setup downloads needed)

# Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nia-the-cat/edge-tts-generate/releases)
2. Unzip the downloaded file if necessary
3. In Anki, go to `Tools` → `Add-ons` → `Install from file...`
4. Select the `.ankiaddon` file and click Open
5. Restart Anki to activate the add-on

# Setup

**No setup required!** The add-on comes with all dependencies bundled. Just install and start generating audio immediately.

The edge-tts library and its dependencies are included in the add-on package using pure Python implementations, ensuring compatibility with Anki's bundled Python on all platforms.

## Using the Add-on

### Accessing Audio Generation

Open the Anki card browser and access the feature through any of these methods:

* **Menu Bar**: `Generate Batch Audio` → `Configure and Generate...` (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
* **Edit Menu**: `Edit` → `Generate edge-tts Audio` (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+E`)
* **Context Menu**: Right-click on any card → `Generate edge-tts Audio`

### Batch Processing

Select multiple cards before opening the dialog to generate audio for all of them at once. 

**Note:** When selecting cards with different note types, only fields that exist in all selected note types will appear in the dropdown.

### Configuration Options

#### 1. Field Selection

* **Source Field**: The field containing text to convert to speech (e.g., `Sentence`, `Expression`, `Word`)
* **Destination Field**: Where to save the generated audio (e.g., `Audio`, `SentenceAudio`)
  - Select `[ + Create new field... ]` to create a new audio field on the fly

#### 2. Audio Handling Mode

Choose how to handle existing content in the destination field:

* **Append (default)** ✅ - Keeps existing content and adds new audio at the end
  - Safest option - won't accidentally delete information
  - Useful when you have multiple audio sources
  
* **Overwrite** ⚠️ - Replaces all content in the destination field with new audio
  - Use when you want to regenerate audio completely
  - **Confirmation required**: A dialog will ask you to confirm before proceeding
  - Warning: Erases existing content
  
* **Skip** ⏭️ - Ignores notes that already have content in the destination field
  - Useful for only filling empty audio fields
  - Saves time when updating a deck

#### 3. Voice Selection

The add-on comes with 20 pre-configured voices across 10 languages:

| Language | Female Voice | Male Voice |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 English (US) | Jenny | Guy |
| 🇬🇧 English (UK) | Sonia | Ryan |
| 🇩🇪 German | Katja | Conrad |
| 🇪🇸 Spanish | Elvira | Alvaro |
| 🇫🇷 French | Denise | Henri |
| 🇮🇹 Italian | Elsa | Diego |
| 🇯🇵 Japanese | Nanami | Keita |
| 🇰🇷 Korean | SunHi | InJoon |
| 🇧🇷 Portuguese (BR) | Francisca | Antonio |
| 🇨🇳 Chinese (Simplified) | Xiaoxiao | Yunxi |

**Preview Voice**: Click the "Preview Voice" button to hear the selected voice. When multiple notes are selected, you can choose which note to use for the preview text.

#### 4. Advanced Options

* **Ignore stuff in brackets [...]** - Removes content in square brackets before generating audio
  - Useful for flashcards with pronunciation hints, pitch accents, or metadata
  - Example: `食べる [たべる]` becomes `食べる`
  
* **Pitch Control** - Adjust voice pitch from -50Hz to +50Hz
* **Speed Control** - Adjust speaking rate from -50% to +50%
* **Volume Control** - Adjust volume from -100% to +100%
* **Reset to Defaults** - Click to reset all voice adjustments (pitch, speed, volume) to their default values (0)

### Generating Audio

1. Configure your preferences in the dialog
2. Select source and destination fields
3. Choose a voice and click "Generate Audio"

### Remembering Your Preferences

The add-on automatically saves all your settings and restores them when you reopen Anki. This includes:

- **Voice selection** - Your last selected voice is remembered
- **Source and destination fields** - Field choices persist across sessions
- **Audio handling mode** - Append, overwrite, or skip preference is saved
- **Voice adjustments** - Pitch, speed, and volume settings are retained
- **Bracket handling** - Your preference for ignoring bracket content is saved

Settings are saved when you click "Generate Audio" (for most options) or immediately when you adjust sliders. All preferences persist even after completely closing and reopening Anki.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Generation Issues

**No Audio Generated**: 
- Verify you have an internet connection (edge-tts requires internet for TTS generation)
- Check that the source field contains text
- Ensure the selected voice supports your language

**HTML Tags in Audio**: The add-on automatically strips HTML tags, but if you're hearing odd content, check your source field for formatting issues.

**Garbled/Wrong Language**: Make sure you've selected a voice that matches your text's language. For example, use a Japanese voice for Japanese text.

### Performance

**Large Batches**: When processing hundreds of cards, generation happens with limited concurrency. Consider processing in smaller batches if needed.

## Configuration

### Adding More Voices

You can add additional voices by editing the add-on configuration:

1. In Anki, go to `Tools` → `Add-ons`
2. Select "EdgeTTS Audio Generator"
3. Click `Config`
4. Add voice identifiers to the `speakers` array

**Finding Voice Names**: Valid voice identifiers follow the pattern `language-REGION-NameNeural`, for example:
- `en-US-AriaNeural`
- `ja-JP-NanamiNeural`
- `de-DE-KatjaNeural`

See [Microsoft's voice documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=tts) for a full list of available voices.

### Advanced Configuration

The add-on also supports these configuration options in `meta.json`:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `stream_timeout_seconds` | 30.0 | Timeout for TTS streaming (seconds) |
| `stream_timeout_retries` | 1 | Number of retries on timeout |
| `log_level` | WARNING | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) |

### Logging and Bug Reports

The add-on includes a logging system to help with debugging and bug reports. Logs are written to `edge_tts.log` in the add-on directory.

**Viewing Logs:**
1. Navigate to your Anki add-ons folder
2. Find the `edge_tts.log` file in the Edge TTS add-on directory
3. Open with any text editor

**Adjusting Log Level:**
1. Go to `Tools` → `Add-ons` → Select "EdgeTTS Audio Generator" → `Config`
2. Add or modify `"log_level": "DEBUG"` for verbose logging
3. Restart Anki for changes to take effect

Available log levels (from most to least verbose):
- `DEBUG` - Detailed information for diagnosing issues
- `INFO` - General operational information
- `WARNING` - Potential issues (default)
- `ERROR` - Errors that prevented an operation
- `CRITICAL` - Serious errors

**For Bug Reports:**
When reporting issues, please include the contents of `edge_tts.log` with `log_level` set to `DEBUG`.
